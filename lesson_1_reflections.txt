How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It is easier to track down the location of the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You’ll be able to see what’s changed over time, and keep yourself from making the same mistakes over and over again. We can also see what features/bugs have been added/fixed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros - control. Cons - might miss some work due to crashes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git’s better for coding where multiple files are inter-connected. Google docs on the other hand only care about one file at a time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log will show us all the commits, and we can use diff to compare different versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can always go back to an older, working/stable version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Any coding projects I work on.
