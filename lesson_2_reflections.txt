What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It lets git know that this directory (and subdirectories) are part of the repository. You need this to start tracking.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It lets you get files ready before committing them to the repository.
