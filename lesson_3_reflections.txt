When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you're working on multiple machines, such as work and home.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because there may be clashes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another

Fork - when you want a copy of a repository within GitHub. This is a GitHub concept
Clone - copying an online/another repository and create a local repository.
Branches/branching - creating a differentiator to a trunk within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You’ll be up to date.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
We’d make sure everything is merged properly.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When you don’t want to effect other people’s work.
